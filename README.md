# Behind Oracles
This repository provides a Qiskit implementation of an oracle that solves a SAT instance.
In particular, two examples are provided:
 - Sat instance with 1 solution,
 - Sat instance with more solutions.

This code is part of my related Medium article which discusses how to implement an oracle. ["Behind Oracles: Grover's Algorithm & Amplitude Amplification"](https://medium.com/@Brotherhood94/46b928b46f1e?source=friends_link&sk=3430cf551467eead4b0e5e8cce9f0548)
